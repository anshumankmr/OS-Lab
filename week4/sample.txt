Assume no duplicate elements while constructing the tree. i. Given a key, perfo
rm a search in the binary search tree. If the key is found then display “key fo
und” else insert the key in the binary searchtree.ii. Display the tree using in
order, preorder and post order traversal methods2) Write a program to implement
the following graph representations anddisplay them. i. Adjaccency matrix
